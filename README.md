## 🧠 What I Learned

Building and refactoring this project allowed me to practice and master several advanced front-end development concepts:

- Advanced CSS Grid: I implemented a complex layout using grid-template-areas to organize the main content, feature info, and the hero image in a responsive-ready structure.

- Semantic HTML5: I moved away from generic containers to semantic tags like header, nav, main, section, and article to improve SEO and accessibility.

- Typography and Color Systems: Integration of the Merriweather font family and a high-contrast dark color palette to enhance readability and professional feel.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5: Semantic structure and accessible markup.

- CSS3: Advanced Grid systems, Flexbox for navigation, and pseudo-elements for UI feedback.

- Google Fonts: Integration of the Merriweather font family.
